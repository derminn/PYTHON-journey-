# TUPLES:-

## 1. What is a Tuple?

A tuple is an **ordered, immutable collection** in Python used to store multiple values in a single variable.

Once created, tuple elements **cannot be changed** (no add, remove, update).

```python
t = (10,20,30)
```

### ✅ Key Properties:

- Ordered (index-based)
- Immutable (cannot modify)
- Allows duplicate values
- Can store mixed data types

---

## 2. Accessing Tuple Elements

```python
t = (10,20,30,40)print(t[0])# 10print(t[-1])# 40print(t[1:3])# (20, 30)
```

---

## 3. Looping Through Tuples

### ➤ Simple for-loop

```python
colors = ("red","blue","green")for colorin colors:print(color)
```

### ➤ Using index

```python
for iinrange(len(colors)):print(i, colors[i])
```

### ➤ Reverse looping

```python
for iinrange(len(colors) -1, -1, -1):print(colors[i])
```

---

## 4. Tuple Unpacking (Important Concept)

Tuple unpacking allows assigning tuple values to variables in one line.

```python
t = (10,20)
a, b = tprint(a, b)
```

### ➤ Swap values using unpacking

```python
a =5
b =10
a, b = b, a
```

### ➤ Loop unpacking (nested tuples)

```python
data = ((1,2), (3,4), (5,6))for x, yin data:print(x + y)
```

---

## 5. enumerate() – Loop with Index + Value

`enumerate()` gives both index and value together.

```python
names = ("ram","shyam","geeta")for i, nameinenumerate(names, start=1):print(i, name)
```

### ➤ Use-case:

- Debugging
- Menus
- Finding positions of values

---

## 6. zip() – Parallel Looping

`zip()` allows looping through multiple tuples/lists together.

```python
names = ("ram","shyam","geeta")
marks = (70,40,85)for name, markinzip(names, marks):print(name,"scored", mark)
```

### ⚠️ Note:

`zip()` stops at the shortest iterable length.

---

## 7. Nested Tuples (Structured Data)

Tuples can contain tuples (like rows in a table):

```python
students = (
    ("ram",80),
    ("shyam",35),
    ("geeta",95)
)
```

### ➤ Pass / Fail Example

```python
for name, marksin students:if marks >=50:print(name,"passed")else:print(name,"failed")
```

---

## 8. Finding Maximum (Topper) Without max()

```python
top_marks = students[0][1]
topper = students[0][0]for name, marksin students:if marks > top_marks:
        top_marks = marks
        topper = nameprint(topper,"got highest marks:", top_marks)
```

---

## 9. Counting with Conditions

```python
failed =0for name, marksin students:if marks <50:
        failed +=1print("Total failed:", failed)
```

---

## 10. Nested Loops with Tuples (2D Data)

```python
grid = (
    (1,2,3),
    (4,5,6),
    (7,8,9)
)for iinrange(len(grid)):for jinrange(len(grid[i])):print(f"row {i}, col{j} ->{grid[i][j]}")
```

---

## 11. break and continue in Nested Loops

### ➤ break (stop when found)

```python
found =Falsefor iinrange(len(grid)):for jinrange(len(grid[i])):if grid[i][j] ==5:print("Found at", i, j)
            found =Truebreakif found:break
```

### ➤ continue (skip values)

```python
for iinrange(len(grid)):for jinrange(len(grid[i])):if grid[i][j] %2 ==0:continueprint(grid[i][j])
```
